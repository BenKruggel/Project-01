# Added additional content to build on original story, as well as fulfill project requirements. Updated main room passage to shorten description upon entering after the first time. I didn't include variables to track statistics, but I added a knot to function as an upgrade after jumping off the platform as a way to progress abilities and unlock different options. After jumping off the first time, more text is added to prompt exploration and the player can inspect the lower platform door to get a secret key and ending. Multiple item pickups function as inventory items, and multiple choices are only available if certain items or rooms have been obtained/visited.
